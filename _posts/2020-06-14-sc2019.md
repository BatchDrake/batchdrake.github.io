On April 6th-7th 2019, the second edition of the [STARcon 2019](https://starcon-ea.github.io/anuncios/2019/03/15/Programa_STARcon-2019.html) congress took place in 
the [ETSIT](http://www.etsit.upm.es/de/school/about-etsit/presentation.html), in which I gave a talk about the state-of-the-art of reverse engineering of
[convolutional encoders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_code), and provided a proof of concept of the ideas 
behind the work of [MÃ©lanie Marazin, Roland Gautier and Gilles Burel](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224093438_Dual_Code_Method_for_Blind_Identification_of_Convolutional_Encoder_for_Cognitive_Radio_Receiver_Design) 
to guess the encoder polynomials of the [Meteor MN2](https://www.wmo-sat.info/oscar/satellites/view/284) [LRPT signal](https://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/Low_Rate_Picture_Transmission_(LRPT)).

My implementation of the algorithm described in the paper was named **cccrack** and, due to my unfathomable lazyness, was not
released since then. Since some interest has been raised about it recently, I'm releasing both the [source code](https://github.com/BatchDrake/cccrack) and 
the [slides (in Spanish)](http://actinid.org/STARcon/STARcon2019.odp) in which I attempt to explain the specifics of this technique. 

It's important to remark that there are two versions of this algorithm, based on _hard_ and _soft_ decisions respectively. My implementation covers
the _hard_ version and, therefore, is extremely sensitive to noise (in fact, bit errors make this implementation useless). Since this
technique is something I want to add to SigDigger, I may end up trying to figure out the _soft_ version of the algorithm.

Stay tuned!
