After some time recurringly spamming in Twitter about what I'm up to without providing too much information about my projects, experiments, research and so on, I think it's about time to put some organization on all the content I'll be generating from now on.

My first objective will be to translate to English a few of my older posts, which I belive to be of interest to some radio(astronomy) nerds out there. Stay tuned!
